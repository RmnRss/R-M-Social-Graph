                            numbers above. We took the well-formatted information about characters from the API and we
                            crossed them with the contents of the wikipedia pages. To create the network we parsed each
                            Wikipedia page of the characters to find hyperlinks to other characters. When a link was
                            found we created an edge (a link/connection) from the given character to the other
                            character. </p>

                        <p> Above you can see the complete character network, we highlighted the Ricks in <b

                            wears throughout the show. We also scaled the node size depending on their degree (how many
                            links/connections they have) which is why Rick & Morty have such big nodes. The three black
                            nodes that are also fairly big represent the remaining members of the Smith family - the
                            father Jerry, the mother Beth and Morty's bigger sister Summer.<br/> Now - Let's dive a
                            little bit deeper into the analysis of our network, by looking at how the characters are
                            connected within the network. </p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <p>In the figure below, we plotted the degree distribution, i.e. number of nodes with a given
                            number of links. On the horizontal x-axis is the degree (number of connections from a given
                            node to other nodes), and on the vertical y-axis is the number of nodes with that given
                            degree value. This plot provides insight about how the connections between characters are
                            distributed in the network, i.e. how many characters have few connections to other
                            characters and how many have a lot of those connections.</p>

                        <p>When we think about it, the plot above shows nothing very surprising. It just confirms
                            something that was expected : Rick & Morty, as well as their family members, have a lot of
                            connections compared to the remaining characters. What is more interesting is that lots of
                            other characters only know a few others, which makes sense considering the structure of the
                            series. As the show focuses on entirely different random adventures for each episode, it's
                            logicial that only the main characters living those adventures have a lot of connections to
                            a lot of other characters whereas most of remaining characters will never get to meet each
                            other.</p>

                    <!-- Centrality Analysis -->

                        <h2>Centrality</h2>
                    </div>

                    <p class="row">Centrality assigns an importance score to a node based purely on its number of
                        connections. So by taking a look at centrality, we can get a glance of which characters are the
                        most popular, or which character to know if I want to know another one. So let's look at which
                        of our characters are the most central.</p>

                    <!-- Betweenness Centrality -->
                    <div class="row">
                        <h3>Betweenness Centrality</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row">
                        <p>Since betweenness is a measure of which node has the shortest paths from A to B going through
                            it, a high betweenness centrality means that this node is the character to know, if you want
                            to be able to get as fast as possible from A to B in the network. For example, if you want
                            to get from Birdperson to Abradolf Lincler, what is the shortest path through the other
                            characters to get to him? The betweenness centrality measure takes all the paths between
                            characters into consideration, and therefore a ranking of characters can be done.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="row justify-content-center">
                        <figure class="img-frame">
                            <img class="img-fluid" src="./plots/centrality_betweenness.png">

                        </figure>

                    <div class="row">
                        <p>As expected, Rick and Morty are most central, followed my the remaining members of the Smith
                            family.
                            Jerry is probably third because he joins Rick and Morty on most adventures, compared to the
                            other
                            two family members. So if I'm a new character in Rick & Morty and I want to meet another
                            one, the
                            optimal way is to ask Rick first, then Morty, then Jerry (you might not want to do that, or
                            the

                            approach used by the algorithm, where nodes are divided into communities if their neighbors
                            contain
                            similar labels. This approach will enhance communities with high-degree (many
                            links/connections)
                            nodes, thus generating this dominant community containing all members of the family. </p>

                        <p> What is interesting about the Louvain algorithm is that the approach it uses to divide
                            communities
                            is similar to greedy modularity maximization. The major difference is the initial grouping
                            of nodes
                            locally. Perhaps this local grouping is the reason why the number of communities is lower
                            than the
                            greedy modularity maximization algorithm. </p><br/>

                        <p>The four different community algorithms divide the characters in slightly different ways. For
                            example, Rick and Morty are not always grouped into the same community. But perhaps more
                            interestingly, Summer Smith is the only member of the Smith family to reside in her own
                            community
                            for most of the algorithms. This could indicate that she is detached from Rick & Morty or
                            detached
                            from the Smith family. Not necessarily jumping to conclusions here, but her not always nice
                            attitude
                            towards Rick & Morty could perhaps explain some of this detachment.<br/> Even though the
                            algorithms
                            provide different results, there are also a number of interesting similarities. For instance
                            the
                            characters Terry and Purple Morty are central within a community for all four algorithms,
                            making
                            them characters worth noting, since they apparently have some central position in the show.
                            All
                            algorithms divide the characters into 15 or less communities. This is quite interesting,
                            since the
                            show contains far many more distinct locations, and we expected a larger number of
                            communities that
                            would be closer to the 100+ locations.</p>

                <p>It was a fun ride wasn't it ? Even though we have not been that surprised by the results. Why, you
                    ask ? We're thinking it's because of the show structure which doesn't appeal to a lot of surprises,
                    since episodes only have a few characters in common and they often introduce lots of new characters.
                    Main findings include: <br/>Rick & Morty being central to the show and absolutely deadly - leading
                    by far in the list of most dangerous characters. And don't forget the deadliness of the show - a
                    staggering <b>36% of characters are dead</b>. And perhaps we should pay more attention to Jerry now
                    that we know he can be quite deadly.<br/> Summer seems to do her own thing, as we saw in the
                    community analysis, where she was part of her own community in most cases.<br/> Finally, we got a
                    sense of the variety of species in the show; <b>10 different known species</b> exist, including
                    Alien, Human, Parasite and the wonderful Poopybutthole species.<br/> That wraps it up for the
                    network analysis and if you've enjoyed the ride so far, don't hesitate to head over to the <a
