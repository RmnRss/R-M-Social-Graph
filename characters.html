Well we used both the the Rickipedia and the Rick & Morty API to come up with the last numbers. We took the well formated informations about characters form the API and we crossed them with the content of the wikipedia pages. To create the networks we parsed each Wikipedia page of the characters to find links. When a link was found we created an edge from the character to the other character. </p>

As expected, Rick and Morty are most central, followed my the remaining members of the Smith family. Jerry is probably third because he joins Rick and Morty on most adventures, compared to the other two family members.</p>

                                        <p>The Eigenvector centrality is a measure of how nodes are connected to other nodes with high degree, and in that sense it is a ranking. Characters have high eigenvector centrality probably because of popularity, i.e. they appear often with other high-degree characters.</p>
                                        <p>Again, Morty and Rick appear with highest centrality, whereas Jerry is on fifth place. Perhaps, like explained above with betweenness, because he is on many adventures in different locations, where a lot of characters with low degrees appear. Simply because these characters appear in locations that make them isolated from the rest of the network.</p>

                                        <p> This section analyzes the communities by comparing four different algorithms for community detection. Plots are used to show the structure of communities and which of the main characters are central to a specific community. For instance if Jerry Smith is the central character in a given community nodes will be colored green to match Jerry's awesome shirt. Likewise for Rick, where nodes are colored turquoise to match his pointy hair. If Rick and Morty are both in the same community, nodes will be colored in a flashy green to recall the portal gun. For each plot, node sizes are dependent on the size of the communities, such that bigger communities have bigger nodes. </p>

As shown by the graph this actually results in community size decreasing simultaneously with the decreasing modularity. Since communities are based upon maximization of modularity, a few big communities exist. This is due to the high degrees of Rick and Morty. This algorithm, as described by it's name, will divide communities with the highest modularity, since that is inherent in the functionality of the algorithm. </p>

The major difference is the initial grouping of nodes locally. Perhaps this local grouping is the reason why Rick and Morty reside in separate communities, as compared to the greedy modularity maximization algorithm. </p>
