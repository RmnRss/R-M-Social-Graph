                                <p class="mt-3">We did so for 313 characters using both the <a href="https://rickandmortyapi.com/">Rick & Morty API</a> & <a href="https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Rickipedia">Rickipedia</a>, a fandom wiki page dedicated to the explore the amazing world of Rick & Morty. Overall, the character statistics are looking like this:</p>

                                <p>From those numbers, we can already see some interesting points. For instance, we decided to address the fact that <b>36 %</b> of them are dead. So we are gonna look deeper at the characters status in the Network and try to find a responsible for all those deaths!<br/> We also noticed that <b>13 %</b> of the characters are Ricks and that <b>10 %</b> are Mortys, which lead us to take a deeper look at character diversity, and their species.</p>

We took the well-formatted information about characters from the API and we crossed them with the contents of the wikipedia pages. To create the networks we parsed each Wikipedia page of the characters to find hyperlinks to other characters. When a link was found we created an edge (a link/connection) from the given character to the other character. </p>

                                        <p>When we think about it, the plot above has nothing very surprising. It just confirms something that was expected : Rick & Morty, as well as their family members, have a big amount of nodes compared to other characters. What is more interesting is that lots of other characters only know a few others, which makes sense considering the structure of the series. As the show focuses on entirely different random adventures for each episodes, it's logicial sense that only the main characters living those adventures have a lot of connexions to a lot of them whereas most of the other characters will never get to meet each other.</p>

                                    <p class="row">Centrality assigns an importance score to a node based purely on its number of nodes. So taking a look at centrality tells us which characters are the most popular, or which character to know if I want to know another one. So let's look at which of our characters are the most central.</p>

                                    <!-- Betweenness Centrality -->
                                    <div class="row">

                                    <div class="row">
                                        <p>Since betweenness is a measure of which node has the shortest paths from A to B going through it, a high betweenness centrality means that this node is the character to know, if you want to be able to get as fast as possible from A to B in the network.</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <figure class="full-width">

                                        <p>As expected, Rick and Morty are most central, followed my the remaining members of the Smith family. Jerry is probably third because he joins Rick and Morty on most adventures, compared to the other two family members. So if I'm a new character in Rick & Morty and I want to meet another one, the optimal way is to ask Rick first, then Morty, then Jerry (you might not want to do that, or the conversation might get very boring), etc.</p>

                                        <p>Again, Morty and Rick appear with highest centrality, whereas Jerry is on fifth place. Perhaps, like explained above with betweenness, because he is on many adventures in different locations, where a lot of characters with low degrees appear. So that makes Jerry popular...</p>

No it's actually a good sign because it shows that the data we collected is in correlation with the show which is a very good things this far!<br/>Rick wins the betweenness centrality contest and Morty has the highest eigenvector centrality. These results match our expectations very well, and could most likely be explained by the fact that Rick knows almost each and every character across all locations and episodes, therefore he has the highest betweenness. Morty on the other hand, is a central member of both the adventures and the Smith family, which makes him more connected to other nodes with high degree than Rick.</p>

Plots are used to show the structure of communities and which of the main characters are central to a specific community. For instance if <b>Jerry Smith</b> is the central character in a given community nodes will be colored <b style="color:#526E2D">darkgreen</b> to match Jerry's awesome shirt. Likewise for Rick, where nodes are colored <b style="color: #00E1FF">turquoise</b> to match his pointy hair. If Rick and Morty are both in the same community, nodes will be colored in a flashy <b style="color:#53FF11">green</b>  to recall the portal gun.<br/> For each plot, node sizes are dependent on the size of the communities, such that bigger communities have bigger nodes. </p>

The number 15 was chosen, since two of the other algorithms divided the characters into exactly 15 distinct communities. </p>

For example, Rick and Morty are not always grouped into the same community. But perhaps more interestingly, Summer Smith is the only member of the Smith family to reside in her own community using most of the algorithms. This could indicate that she is detached from the Rick & Morty or detached from the Smith family. Not necessarily jumping to conclusions here, but her not always nice attitude towards Rick & Morty could perhaps explain some of this detachment.<br/> Even though the algorithms provide different results, there are also a number of interesting similarities. For instance the characters Terry and Purple Morty are central within a community for all four algorithms, making them characters worth noting, since they apparently have some central position in the show. All algorithms divide the characters into 15 or less communities. This is quite interesting, since the show contains far many more distinct locations, and we expected a larger number of communities that would be closer to the 100+ locations.</p>

Main findings include: <br/>Rick & Morty being central to the show and absolutely deadly - leading by far in the list of most dangerous characters. And don't forget the deadliness of the show - a staggering 36% of characters are dead. And perhaps we should pay more attention to Jerry now that we know he can be quite deadly.<br/> Summer seems to do her own thing, as we saw in the community analysis, where she was part of her own community in most cases.<br/> Finally, we got a sense of the variety of species in the show; 10 different known species exist, including Alien, Human, Parasite and the wonderful Poopybutthole species.<br/> That wraps it up for the network analysis and if you've enjoyed the ride so far, don't hesitate to head over to the <a href="./nlp.html">Natural Language Processing page</a>, for much more schwiftiness!</p>
