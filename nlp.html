      <section class="head-section">
        <h1>Episodes Transcripts</h1>

        <p>
          In this section, we will tackle everything related with Natural
          Language Processing. We will talk about how we analyze song lyrics and
          episodes transcripts and then discuss the results!
        </p>

        <!-- Sentiment Score -->
        <!-- General View -->
        <h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>

        <p>
          The first type of analysis we ran through the episode transcripts, was
          a Sentiment Analysis. What is sentiment you may ask? Well when it
          comes to data science, the sentiment is a measure of how the word is
          perceived by people. Depending on the perception (positive or
          negative) each word is given a grade from 0 (very bad) to 9 (very
          good) a word is. For example "love" has a very high sentiment score,
          whereas "terror" has a very bad one.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we used a labMT word data-base and their sentiment score to
          calculate the average sentiment score of each episode. This way we
          could have an idea of how Rick & Morty language would be perceived. We
          got the following results :
        </p>

        <figure class="img-frame">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="./plots/sentiment_score_ep.png" />
          <figcaption class="caption">
            Average sentiment score per episode
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure class="img-frame">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="./plots/sentiment_score_season.png" />
          <figcaption class="caption">Average Sentiment per seasons</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          So it appears that overall the sentiment score of each episode and
          season is just around the average. But the general reviews of Rick &
          Morty often shows that it's a pretty fun and happy show, so how could
          that be explained ?
        </p>

        <p>
          There is a few things to consider, the first one being
          <b>swearing</b>, there is a lot of swearing in the show, and most of
          the time the sentiment score of a swear word isn't that good. Whereas
          the R&M audience might find this overuse of swearing pretty funny. So
          this is something that might have decreased the overall scores. But we
          will discuss swearing a lot more later on !<br />The second element to
          consider is also the word creativity is Rick & Morty, new words appear
          every episode, new puns, etc. All those new words are not taken into
          consideration when calculating sentiment scores, even though they are
          also well perceived and are a reason R&M is a highly rated show.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then we can notice another trend while looking at the last numbers,
          over time the score is decreasing when it comes to Rick & Morty.
          <br />
          It might a hint, that overall the choices of words are changing and
          not in a good way. The words chosen by the writers are getting rougher
          over the course of time. But does that mean that the episodes are less
          appreciated?
        </p>

        <h3>Comparing Sentiment to IMDB Ratings</h3>

        <figure class="img-frame">
          <img
            class="img-fluid"
            src="./plots/sentiment_score_ep_vs_ratings.png"
          />
          <figcaption class="caption">
            Sentiment Score vs. IMDB Ratings
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          To answer the last question we decided to fetch IMDB ratings of the
          show and to compare them to sentiment score to see if there were any
          correlation between the two. <br />
          And well, even though the sentiment score decreases over time, the
          ratings do not and they even reach their all-time high for the last
          season of the show. So maybe sentiment wasn't really the best way to
          analyze Rick & Morty language. But we'll give it one last chance :
        </p>

        <h3>The most positive character ?</h3>

        <p>
          We took a deeper look at the sentiment score for Rick & Morty
          especially. We ran the sentiment score algorithm only for their lines,
          to see who was contributing the most to the happiness of the show, and
          see who was the bummer.
        </p>

        <figure class="img-frame">
          <div class="d-flex align-content-center justify-content-center">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="./plots/rm_sentiment_score.png" />
          </div>

          <figcaption class="caption">
            Rick vs Morty sentiment scores over time
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          First, we can see that Rick & Morty's lines are aligned with the
          previous results we got, when their sentiment score decreases so does
          the overall shows'. Apart from that, both characters' way of
          expressing themselves is full of ups and downs. The only clear
          conclusion here is that the second half of the last season was the
          least sentimental one for Rick and Morty.
        </p>

        <!-- Words -->
        <h2>It's all about the words!!</h2>

        <p>
          Enough about sentiment, we clearly just realized that sentiment could
          not really give us the full taste of Rick & Morty. So we'll dive
          deeper into swear words and words creativity.
        </p>

        <h3>Most used words for Rick & Morty</h3>

        <p>
          A nice thing to do when you have access to the transcript is to look
          for the most frequent/important words. We did that by parsing
          transcripts and applying TF-IDF to their respective lines over all the
          episodes transcripts. TF-IDF is "a statistical measure used to
          evaluate how important a word is to a document in a collection or
          corpus". So we used TF-IDF most important words for Rick & Morty that
          we snapped into some
          <b>schwifty</b> word clouds:

        <p>
          As it turns out, the words with the highest TF-IDF scores describe
          quite well the characters. Morty's infamous
          <b>'ohh'</b> is the most typical response of his - no matter if he's
          bored, happy, or terrified - his reaction usually comes down to
          emotionless 'ooh'. But then he apparently mentions "poncho" a lot too
          ?! And "bailed" isn't too surprising as Morty's word is often "Thanks
          for bailing me out Rick".

          For Rick, it's even more iconic. Maybe it's not a word but still -
          Rick <b>burps</b> all the time, and here we see that it was always
          carefully noted down in the transcript files. Rick also loves
          mentioning sauce and the world "new". The later being less suprising
          as he also invents or discovers new stuffs.

          For each season we can see that the top words are heavily influenced
          by the theme of some episodes, for the first season words like
          meeseeks, dogs, and snuffles appear. Or even for the third season,
          clearly with the presence of one of the most famous quote of the show:
          "I'm Pickle Riiiiiiiick !".

        <!-- Swear Words -->
        <h3>Swearing Analysis</h3>

        <p>
          Rick & Morty is known for its rough language, so we decided to dig a
          little deeper into this, to find the most used swears, who uses the
          most and also their importance in the show's success & flow.
        </p>

        <p>
          A little bit earlier, we introduced you to sentiment score, now let's
          talk about profanity score! We used the
          <a
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            href="https://github.com/vzhou842/profanity-check"
            >profanity check library</a
          >
          to calculate it but what does it do? When given a string it analyzes
          it and returns a probability (score between 0 and 1) of the string to
          be offensive. So "F*** you!" would return 1, whereas "go to hell, you
          scum!" would return something around 0.8. So using this library on the
          transcript can tell you if they are more or less offensive.
        </p>

          <figcaption class="caption">Profanity score per season</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          First we can notice that profanity score are pretty low on a scale to
          one, they are all around 0.12. This can be explained by the fact that
          we are calculating profanity score on average, and most of the
          transcript are not swears, so that would defenitely lower the score.
          <br />If we are now looking at scores over time they are all the same
          over the seasons, except for the last one who has slightly lower
          average, so that proably means less swear words. So if we think back
          at our sentiment analysis we can probably forget the hypothesis that
          stated that swear words would lower the score for the last season.
        </p>

        <h3>Comparing Profanity Scores & IMDB Ratings</h3>

        <figure class="img-frame">

          <figcaption class="caption">Profanity Score vs. Ratings</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          As we did for the sentiment score let's compare profanity score and
          ratings to see if it actually matters. And it appears that it does,
          ratings and profanity score, for the most part, seems to be in sync,
          does that mean that the more swear words the better the episode? From
          our point of you, it's not the only parameters but yes it counts!
        </p>

        <h4>Swearing Contest !</h4>

        <p>
          It has become a tradition for us, to compare Rick & Morty's line.
          Let's do it again for swearing!
        </p>

        <figure class="img-frame">
          <div class="d-flex justify-content-center align-content-center">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="./plots/rm_profanity_score.png" />
          </div>

          <figcaption class="caption">Sentiment Score vs. Profanity</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The plot above gives an insight into how the vulgarity of Rick's and
          Morty's language was changing over time. On the x-axis, there are
          seasons (divided into halves: a and b) while the y-axis represents the
          profanity score. Morty's style is more or less consistent through-out
          3 seasons with the peak somewhere between the end of season 2 and the
          beginning of season 3. When it comes to Rick, here the analysis
          becomes a bit more interesting. From the very beginning of the series
          till the first half of season 2 his profanity score fluctuates around
          the same values as Morty did. But in the second half of the last
          season, the number of swear words skyrockets, while Morty's score
          declines sharply. One could put forward a thesis that Rick's language
          became much vulgar under the influence of Morty, while Morty's
          temperament melted down.

        <h3>Made Up Words!!</h3>

        <p>
          Another fact about Rick & Morty is their creativity when it comes to
          inventing new funny words, so let's see what we can find in there :

      <section>
        <h1>Songs</h1>

        <p>
          Aww Jeez, Rick & Morty songs, let's try and figure out what makes them
          so special !
        </p>

        <!-- Sentiment -->
        <h2>Sentiment</h2>

        <figure class="img-frame">
          <div class="d-flex justify-content-center align-content-center">

          </div>

          <figcaption class="caption">Sentiment Score per songs</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          As it turns out, the sentiment score varies across the series'
          discography. The songs with the lowest scores are: 'Luppoo Luppoo' and
          'I'm a Tax Attorney'. The first one consists only of made-up,
          meaningless words while in the second one a comedian is singing that
          no religion can be compared to him being a Tax Attorney - which also
          seems a bit emotionless. When it comes to the songs with the highest
          score, the winner is 'Handy Hands'. It was sung in the episode
          "Raising Gazorpazorp. When Morty was raising Morty Jr., he turned on
          the TV to a children show where a man was singing this tune. Later in
          the episode, the song was sung again by Morty to calm Morty Jr. down,
          which succeeded, and also made him sing along - could you imagine
          anything more sentimental than this?

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Wo weee ! So we've just taken a deeper look into Rick & Morty's
          transcripts. We've found that sentiment scores might be a little
          tricky to analyze a show such as R&M, as it contains a lot of swearing
          and puns that unfortunately sentiment scores cannot consider yet. Then
          we also looked at the swear words in the show, and we've discovered
          that it might be important for the fans even though their presence
          wasn't that important overall. We've also dug into the words of Rick &
          Morty and discovered that often they are influenced by their current
          adventures and that the main characters have their own famous lines!
