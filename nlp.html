                                        <p> What is sentiment you may ask ? Well when it comes to data science, sentiment is a measure of how comonly positive a word is. 
                                            For exemple happy has a very high sentiment score whereas terrible as a bad one. So we took all the sentiment for each words in each transcripts and calculate the avergae sentiment score to have an idea of how good Rick & Morty transcripts were. We got the following results  </p>

                                        <p> So it appears that sentiment over the course of time is decreasing when it comes to Rick & Morty but what does that mean ? Well, it means that overall the word chosen by the writters over the season have a worst and worst corellation, but does that means that the episodes are less appreciated ?  </p>

                                        <p> Well the upper graphs compares the sentiment score of each episode to their number of views in millions during the premiere in Adult Swim. And clearly, the views are inverted to the sentiment score as the number of views increases when the sentiment score decrease. But this can be explained by the increasing popularity of the show over the years and not really because of the content of the episodes. </p>

On the x-axis there are seasons (divided into halves: a and b) while the y-axis represents the profanity score. Morty's style is more or less consistent through-out 3 seasons with the peak somewhere between the end of season 2 and the beginning of season 3. When it comes to Rick, here the analysis becomes a bit more interesting. From the very beginnin of the series till the first half of season 2 his profanity score fluctuates around the same values as Morty did. But in the second half of the last season the number of the swear words skyrockets, while the Morty's score declines sharply. One could put forward a thesis that the Rick's language became much vulgar under the influence of Morty, while Morty's temperament melted down.</p>
