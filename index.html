                                <p>Well first let's try and discuss a bit about the characters of Rick & Morty. Here are a few stats about the characters : </p>

                                </table>
                                <p>From those number we can see some interesting points, that we decided to look into : So out of 313 characters 36 % of them are dead, interesting. We can also notice that 13 % of the characters are Ricks and that 10% are Mortys.</p>

                                        <p>As expected, Rick and Morty are most central, followed my the remaining members of the Smith family. Jerry is probably third because he joins Rick and Morty on most adventures, compared to the other two family members.</p>

Characters have high eigenvector centrality probably because of popularity, i.e. they appear often with other high-degree characters.</p>
                                        <p>Again, Morty and Rick appear with highest centrality, whereas Jerry is on fifth place. Perhaps, like explained above with betweenness, because he is on many adventures in different locations, where a lot of characters with low degrees appear. Simply because these characters appear in locations that make them isolated from the rest of the network.</p>

                                            <p>It's without any surprise that Rick & Morty are the most dangerous characters but the, apparently, otherwise innocent father, Jerry Smith, gets the third place in our rankings of most dangerous character in the whole series, beating his own wife & daughter. Even though those characters also have a lot of nodes and appears often so their chance of being next to dead characters also increase. But when we forget about the Smith family we also stumble on the infamous Evil Morty, & Worldender. Not surprising again but Beth & Summer better work on their danger game during season 4 otherwise Evil Morty might pass them !</p>

Plots are used to show the structure of communities and which of the main characters are central to a specific community. For instance if Jerry Smith is the central character in a given community nodes will be colored green to match Jerry's awesome shirt. Likewise for Rick, where nodes are colored turquoise to match his pointy hair. If Rick and Morty are both in the same community, nodes will be colored red. For each plot, node sizes are dependent on the size of the communities, such that bigger communities have bigger nodes. </p>

As shown by the graph this actually results in community size decreasing simultaneously with the decreasing modularity. Since communities are based upon maximization of modularity, a few big communities exist. This is due to the high degrees of Rick and Morty. This algorithm, as described by it's name, will divide communities with the highest modularity, since that is inherent in the functionality of the algorithm. </p>

All members of the Smith family are clustered together into one large community that dominates the graph, also visually. This large community exists because of the labelling approach used by the algorithm, where nodes are divided into communities if their neighbors contain similar labels. This approach will enhance communities with high-degree nodes, thus generating this dominant community containing all members of the family. </p>

The major difference is the initial grouping of nodes locally. Perhaps this local grouping is the reason why Rick and Morty reside in separate communities, as compared to the greedy modularity maximization algorithm. </p>

                                            For exemple happy has a very high sentiment score whereas terrible as a bad one.
